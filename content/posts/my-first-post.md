Starting out a blog to document my learnings in python, data science and AI.

First up, getting a [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) powered blog using the [minimo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/) up and running on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with [continuous deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/) every time I push new content to github.
