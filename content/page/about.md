Hi, I'm Khalid, data scientist in the making.

After my MBA, I worked in investment analysis for a time, which led me to work with humongous spreadsheets and VBA, which led me to think there has to be a better way to crunch numbers... which led me to python.

Some of the learnings I did along the way:

- [Harvards CS109 data science class](http://khalido.org/posts/harvard-cs109-notes/) - this was a comprehensive introduction to data science, and covers a lot of ground from intermediate python all the way to different machine learning techniques and neural networks.
