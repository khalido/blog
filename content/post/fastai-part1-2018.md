This is a great top down introduction to deep learning. Jeremey Howard is a great teacher. This is probably the best AI course on the interwebs. The [fast.ai course websites](http://course.fast.ai/) blurb:

> This 7-week course is designed for anyone with at least a year of coding experience, and some memory of high-school math. You will start with step one—learning how to get a GPU server online suitable for deep learning—and go all the way through to creating state of the art, highly practical, models for computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

__notes to follow__.
