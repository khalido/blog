      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Khalid, data scientist in the making.
After my MBA, I worked in investment analysis for a time, which led me to work with humongous spreadsheets and VBA, which led me to think there has to be a better way to crunch numbers&amp;hellip; which led me to python.
Some of the more useful learnings I did along the way:
Harvards CS109 data science class - this was a comprehensive introduction to data science, and covers a lot of ground from intermediate python all the way to different machine learning techniques and neural networks.</description>
