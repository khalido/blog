 training is a highly iterative process as you test ideas and parameters even highly skilled practicioners find it impossible to predict the best parameters for a problem, so going through split data into train/dev/test sets  training set - the actual dataset used to train the model cross validation or dev set - used to evaluate the model test set - only used once the model is finally trained to get a unbiased estimate of the models performance  depending on the dataset size, use different splits, eg:  100 to 1M ==&amp;gt; 60/20/20 1M to INF ==&amp;gt; 98/1/1 or 99.</description>

      <description>It had been a while since I finished Udacity&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning course, so as a refresher I signed up for Andrew NG&amp;rsquo;s deeplearning.ai course.
These are my notes for the first course in the series: Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

      <description>This is a great top down introduction to deep learning. Jeremey Howard is a great teacher. This is probably the best AI course on the interwebs. The fast.ai course websites blurb:
 This 7-week course is designed for anyone with at least a year of coding experience, and some memory of high-school math. You will start with step one—learning how to get a GPU server online suitable for deep learning—and go all the way through to creating state of the art, highly practical, models for computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.</description>

      <description>My notes &amp;amp; files for Udacity&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning intro course.
Before the course starts:  Read Machine learning is fun Watch Andrew NG: Deep Learning in Practice (34 minutes) Go though UD730 deep learning course on Udacity Watch Learn tensorflow 3 hour video http://rodneybrooks.com/patrick-winston-explains-deep-learning/  Python resources The course recommneds knowing basic python from here, but I found the following two resources better:
 A whirlwind tour of Python Python Data Science Handbook  Math resources Need to know multivariable calculus &amp;amp; linear algebra.</description>

      <description>I really liked this class - it was a engaging course to do after having done some intro level stuff.
 6.00.2x will teach you how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals and provides you with a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving . This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity.</description>

      <description>This was one of Udacity&amp;rsquo;s first computer science MOOC&amp;rsquo;s, and I really liked it. Its a great fast intro to computer science concepts and python.
In particular, I liked that the class both had a cameo by Google&amp;rsquo;s founder and the final project was to build a simple version of Google&amp;rsquo;s original search engine using the pagerank algorithim.</description>
