      <description>This is a great top down introduction to deep learning. Jeremey Howard is a great teacher. This is probably the best AI course on the interwebs. The fast.ai course websites blurb:
 This 7-week course is designed for anyone with at least a year of coding experience, and some memory of high-school math. You will start with step one—learning how to get a GPU server online suitable for deep learning—and go all the way through to creating state of the art, highly practical, models for computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.</description>

      <description>My notes &amp;amp; files for Udacity&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning intro course.
Before the course starts:  Read Machine learning is fun Watch Andrew NG: Deep Learning in Practice (34 minutes) Go though UD730 deep learning course on Udacity Watch Learn tensorflow 3 hour video http://rodneybrooks.com/patrick-winston-explains-deep-learning/  Python resources The course recommneds knowing basic python from here, but I found the following two resources better:
 A whirlwind tour of Python Python Data Science Handbook  Math resources Need to know multivariable calculus &amp;amp; linear algebra.</description>
