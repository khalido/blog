      <description>Blogs on data science, AI, machine learning etc etc. which I liked.
Chris Albon&amp;rsquo;s notes on data science and ai
This is amazingly awesome. Essentially he has put online all his programming notes, broken down into bite sized chunks on how to do stuff, all organized neatly and accessibly.
This is the blog I want to be. He has a somewhat ugly way to transform ipython notebooks into markdown files which hugo processes into html - its way ugly really but I&amp;rsquo;m going to try it out cause jupyter notebooks are awesome.</description>
