      "---\ntitle: Monty Hall\n\ndate: 2019-07-05\ntags: [python]\nsummary: \"Monty Hall brain teaser\"\ndescription: \"Monty Hall brain teaser\"\n---\n\n\nThe famous [Monty Hall brain teaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem):\n> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors:Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\nThere is a really [fun discussion over at Marilyn vos Savant's site](http://marilynvossavant.com/game-show-problem/).\n\nOk, now to setup the problem, along with some kind of visuals and what not.\n\n## setting up a game\n\nThere are many ways to do this, but to keep it simple and human comprehensible I'm going to do it one game at a time. \n\nFirst up, a helper function which takes the door number guessed and the door opened up the host to reveal a goat, and returns the switched door:\n<div class=\"codecell\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"input_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n```python\ndef switch_door(guess, goat_door_opened):\n    \"\"\"takes in the guessed door and the goat door opened\n    and returns the switched door number\"\"\"\n    doors = [0,1,2]\n    doors.remove(goat_door_opened)\n    doors.remove(guess)\n    return doors[0]\n```\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nNow the actual monty hall function - it takes in a guess and whether you want to switch your guess, and returns True or False depending on whether you win\n<div class=\"codecell\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"input_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n```python\ndef monty_hall(guess=0, switch_guess=False, open_goat_door=True):\n    \"\"\"sets up 3 doors 0-2, one which has a pize, and 2 have goats.\n    takes in the door number guessed by the player and whether he/she switched door\n    after one goat door is revealed\"\"\"\n    \n    doors = [door for door in range(3)]\n    np.random.shuffle(doors)\n    prize_door = doors.pop()\n    \n    goat_door_opened = doors[0]\n    \n    if goat_door_opened == guess:\n        goat_door_opened = doors[1]\n        \n    if switch_guess:\n        return switch_door(guess, goat_door_opened) == prize_door\n    else:\n        return guess == prize_door\n```\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nNow to run through a bunch of monty hall games:\n<div class=\"codecell\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"input_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n```python\nno_switch = np.mean([monty_hall(random.randint(0,2), False) for _ in range(100000)])\nno_switch\n```\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"output_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n    0.33196\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nNot switching doors wins a third of the time, which makes intuitive sense, since we are choosing one door out of three.\n<div class=\"codecell\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"input_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n```python\nyes_switch = np.mean([monty_hall(random.randint(0,2), True) for _ in range(100000)])\nyes_switch\n```\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"output_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n    0.66534\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nThis is the suprising result, since switching our guess increases the win rate to two third! To put it more graphically:\n<div class=\"codecell\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"input_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n<details class=\"description\">\n    <summary>Code details ...</summary>\n    \n```python\n#collapse-hide\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,8))\nax.set_title(\"Switching\", fontsize=16)\nax.pie([yes_switch, no_switch], labels=[\"Switching win %\", \"Not switching win %\"],\n       autopct='%1.1f%%', explode=(0, 0.05));\n```\n\n</details>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"output_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n\n![svg](monty_hall_files/output_10_0.svg)\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nSo our chances of winning essentially double if we switch our guess once a goat door has been opened.\n\nThis is a good [monty hall infographic](https://somethingaweek.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/22-lets-make-a-deal/).\n\n## the no reveal month\n\nSo what if Monty never opens a goat door, and just gives us a change to switch the guessed door? Does the winning % still change?\n\nSo first we change the switch door function to remove the reveal option:\n<div class=\"codecell\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"input_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n```python\ndef switch_door_no_revel(guess):\n    \"\"\"takes in the guessed door\n    and returns the switched door number\"\"\"\n    doors = [0,1,2]\n    doors.remove(guess)\n    np.random.shuffle(doors)\n    return doors[0]\n```\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nThen I removed the revealing the goat door code from the original monty hall function above:\n<div class=\"codecell\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"input_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n```python\ndef monty_hall_no_reveal(guess=0, switch_guess=False):\n    \"\"\"sets up 3 doors 0-2, one which has a pize, and 2 have goats.\n    takes in the door number guessed by the player and whether he/she switched door\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    doors = [door for door in range(3)]\n    np.random.shuffle(doors)\n    prize_door = doors.pop()\n        \n    if switch_guess:\n        return switch_door_no_revel(guess) == prize_door\n    else:\n        return guess == prize_door\n```\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nNow to run some sims:\n<div class=\"codecell\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"input_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n```python\nno_switch_no_reveal = np.mean([monty_hall_no_reveal(random.randint(0,2), False) for _ in range(100000)])\nyes_switch_no_reveal = np.mean([monty_hall_no_reveal(random.randint(0,2), True) for _ in range(100000)])\n```\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"codecell\" markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"input_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n```python\nplt.bar([0,1], [yes_switch_no_reveal, no_switch_no_reveal], \ntick_label=[\"Switched Guess\",\"Didn't Switch\"], color=[\"blue\",\"red\"], alpha=0.7)\nprint(\"Switching a door if a goat door hasn't been revealed\")\n```\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"output_area\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n    Switching a door if a goat door hasn't been revealed\n\n\n\n![svg](monty_hall_files/output_18_1.svg)\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nThere is no impact of switching our guess if a goat door hasn't been revealed. Which makes sense to, since whatever door we choose, it has 1/3 probablity of winning. \n\n"
