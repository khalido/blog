I test out the pinboard api to:

- download all my data
- use the api to grab the most recent data since the last time
- integrate it all into one big database of sorts
- chuck in into my blog in all the right places.

Some issues:
- I have too many tags on pinboard, so that will litter my blog with too many unwanted pages. Rationalize all the different tags.
- should these links integrate with the main blog or go elsewhere under a links section.

Inspired by how [kottke.org](https://kottke.org/) has links to interesting stuff as well as blog posts.


```python
