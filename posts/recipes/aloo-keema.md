# Aloo Keema

Recipe in progress in an attempt to recreate a vegan version of homestyle aloo keema.

## Ingredients

- 350 gms vegan mince, pea protein based
- 2 tomatoes diced
- 1 onion sliced and cut a bit more
- 1-2 green chilis, chopped
- 1 tsp garlic crushed
- 1 tsp ginger minced
- 1/2 tsp tamarind paste
- coriander, half bunch
- 1-2 potatoes, cubed small and boiled for 5 minutes
- 1 tsp zeera (cumin seeds) - make this 1/2 tsp I think

### Spices

Spices vary a lot in different home style recipes. So long as you have chilli you can't really go wrong. Vegan mince needs a lot of spice to cover up its lack of flavour compared to actual meat.

- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp haldi (tumeric)
- 1/4 tsp cumin powder
- 1/4 tsp coriander powder
- 1/2 tsp chilli powder
- 1/2 tsp garam masala (optional)
- ground black pepper, just a bit

## Steps

1. heat oil to medium, fry onions for 5-6 minutes, lower heat
2. add in cumin seeds, fry for 1/2 minute
3. Add chilli, fry 1-2 minutes
4. Add garlic, ginger and tamarind paste, fry for a 1 minute
5. add spices, stir
6. Add frozen mince, it takes a few minutes to settle down
7. add potatoes and fry 2-3 minutes
8. Add tomotoes, stir through for 2 minutes
9. add 1/2 cup water then put a lid on, lower heat all the way. 5-8 minutes
10. remove lid, stir for 2-3 minutes to get rid of remaining water
11. check if potatoes soft enough to eat, and if so, add coriander, stir through and servce

Optional: Add chopped fresh ginger and chilli as garninsh, serve with lemon or lime wedges.

This recipe feeds 3ish ppl. Makes good cold sandwhiches the next day,

## Notes:

- try with 100-200g frozen peas
- garam masala yeah or nay?
- don't use soy or tvp mince, they have a strong taste
