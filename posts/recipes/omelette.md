# Omelette

## Ingredients

- 2 organic eggs
- tomato diced
- coriander, diced
- onion, diced
- chilli, diced

## Spice

- 1/4 tsp desi chilli (or thai if no desi) 
- 1/4 tsp salt 
- pinch of tumeric/haldi

## Directions

- break eggs into a bowl, add all the veggies as you see fit
- add spices
- whisk a bit
- optional: add a small splash of milk and a bit of cheese
- fry half the mixture on a flat pan, flip and don't fold over

Serve with toast or paratha.

Note: If you diced a whole onion/coriander/tomato, that will do for 2-3 serves. Obviously you need at least a chilli per serve.

Note: this recipe is as good as it gets, don't add no grama masala or anything.
