- Add all the spices and fry till the oil seperates
- Add potatoes and mix for 5-6 minutes
- Crack in the eggs eggs and keep mixing for 3-4 minutes till eggs are cooked enough to not stick.

Serve with a bit of coriander and a pinch of garama masala on top.

## Notes
The traditional anda aloo ka salan is more of a salan with boiled eggs floating in it. Never liked it heaps, this one is just plain tastier.

A more traditional recipe looks like Spice Spoon's [Ami's Aloo Anday](https://www.thespicespoon.com/blog/egg-potato-curry/).
