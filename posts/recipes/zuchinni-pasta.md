# Zucchini pasta

My one and only pasta receipe.

## Ingredients

- 6-8 Zuchinnis, sliced into half moons
- 4 tomatoes, rinsed and diced
- garlic, lots of it, 6 cloves diced, ideally fresh
- 1-2 chillis (optional)
- shallots (optional)
- Penne Pasta
- mint, chopped
- parmesan cheese, fancy as you want it to be, shredded or shaved
- salt

## Steps

- heat a large frypan on medium with lots of oil and fry garlic and shallows for 1-2 minutes
- turn up heat and add the zuchhni, salt generously
- let it be for 5 minutes, stir once and let it be again. Too much stirring breaks it up. Fry until looking slightly caramalized.
- boil pasta, drain and put into bowls
- add zuchinni, tomatoes and mint

Serve with parmesan and a salt grinder. Fast, easy, delicious.
