Recepies I use regularly. Short, to the point and all vegetarian. Most of them are basically the same but different ingredients, all based on the basic desi karahi and keema base receipe.

Shoutout to various family members for the actual recepies!

Recepies I want but can't make yet:

- the karachi anda dal bun kebab
- a non baked biryani 
- a desi-english style stew
