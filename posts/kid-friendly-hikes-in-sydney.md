### Hermitage Foreshore track

https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/hermitage-foreshore-track

A lovely 5k hike. Good chunks of it feel like you are really out in the bush, and as a bonus there are 3-4 small beaches to swim at.

Park at [Nielsen Park](https://goo.gl/maps/c78N7XA4AppeBBSa9), walk to [Bottle and Glass Point](https://goo.gl/maps/TgRFFgKhzWCGBPMu7) and start the hike from there.
