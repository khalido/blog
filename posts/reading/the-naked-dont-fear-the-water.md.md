# The Naked Don't Fear the Water
[Matthieu Aikins](https://maikins.com/) follows a brown refugee from Afghanistan through to Europe. It gives you an inside view of a refugees journey, starting from the why, to the how.

I would have preferred to read an account written by an actual migrant first hand, but they are obviously too busy with a ton of real life issues to be writing books on a very dangerous journey.  

> Imagine the cities of the world connected by a network of paths that measure not physical distance but danger: the risk of getting arrested, stuck in transit, scammed, kidnapped, or killed.

This book is a must read in a world where the disparity between the truly poor and the first world middle class seems to keep increasing and forcing more and more people to seek a better life elsewhere.
