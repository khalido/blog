So many ideas. It's my favourite first contact book. While some of the ideas might be over the top, they keep coming. Whats really impressive is that this is just book 1 of a trilogy and the ideas keep going.

This is a seminal work in science fiction, the kind which only comes once a decade (if so). I still think about the ideas and philosophies in the book

Thank god the internet exists as this book is best read alongside learning more about some of the things mentioned.
