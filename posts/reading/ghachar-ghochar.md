# Ghachar Ghochar

A family goes from poverty to money - and it tears them apart. A hard look inside one family's financial journey.

What's really interesting is how the author shows us that poor families are a community, within themselves, their neighbours and the people they work with, but rich families are individual unto to themselves.
