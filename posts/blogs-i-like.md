Blogs on data science, AI, machine learning etc etc. which I liked.

[Chris Albon's notes on data science and ai](https://chrisalbon.com/)

This is amazingly awesome. Essentially he has put [online](https://github.com/chrisalbon/notes) all his programming notes, broken down into bite sized chunks on how to do stuff, all organized neatly and accessibly.

This is the blog I want to be. He has a [somewhat ugly way to transform ipython notebooks into markdown files](https://github.com/chrisalbon/notes/blob/master/make.ipynb) which hugo processes into html - its way ugly really but I'm going to try it out cause jupyter notebooks are awesome.

[ADVENTURES IN DEEP LEARNING](https://www.zerotosingularity.com/)

This guy is documenting his deep learning journey from zero to hero. Though thats a bit misleading as he already was a computer scientist.
