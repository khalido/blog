tl;dr buy if your'e a google tragic, else for almost any conceivable use any recent ipad is better.

**Performance:** Fast enough for regular use, but feels both slightly slower and laggier than my pixel 7 pro. Its the same chip, but with less memory and its probably a cheaper lower binned version of the G2 processor, so definitely a tiny bit slower.

However, if you want to edit videos or audio, than this tablet isn't for you. Just stop reading and buy an ipad. This is a newspaper reading photo browsing video watching machine.

The lag isn't just perceptual - a lot of the reviews blamed its lag and sometimes a a jitterness on it being a 60hz screen, but I have a 2020 ipad air which is also 60hz but feels faster and smoother.

In situations where both the pixel and ipad are fast enough - display a simple web page and sroll up and down, when scrolling fast you see dropped frames on the pixel tablet - the ipad does some processing magic to make its 60hz screen feel smoother.

**Display**: Is fine, though I wish the screen ration was was closer to the ipad's one. Its a bit too narrow to hold vertically.

**Case:** This really needs a case, its a bit slippery and pretty thin - compared an ipad air it felt fragile. Even putting it down on a table you have to be careful.  It just doesn't have a nice solid feel.
