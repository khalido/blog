Equipment needed: 

- Rings, height adjustable to transition for pullups, dips and rows.
- 12 and 18kg kettlebell (any cast iron one.)

Notes:

- `3x5` means 3 sets of 5 reps
- use a foam roller before and after

## Travel Routine

Sometimes you got no stuff. Then:

- do the warm-up as above.
- run! 
- a few pushups, planks, whatever.

Done.
