VS Code has so many extensions and stuff, that this is an evoloving list of useful things I've found for it.

[Sanddance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msrvida.vscode-sanddance - this is great, point it at a csv file and boom! you can see your data. [website](https://sanddance.js.org/)

> By using easy-to-understand views, SandDance helps you find insights about your data, which in turn help you tell stories supported by data, build cases based on evidence, test hypotheses, dig deeper into surface explanations, support decisions for purchases, or relate data into a wider, real world context.

> SandDance uses unit visualizations, which apply a one-to-one mapping between rows in your database and marks on the screen. Smooth animated transitions between views help you to maintain context as you interact with your data.

[Visual Studio IntelliCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode) - provides AI assisted autocomplete for python and typescript/javascript. Its trained on high quality github code and suggests the most relevant suggestion first.
