cucumber + mint raita

## Ingredients

- 1-2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 big cucmber or 2 smallish
- 1-2 cup greek yoghurt (or more, whatever fits in your bowl)
- half a bunch worth of fresh mint leaves, chopped fine
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 chilli, deseeded and cut (optional, cause a good raita isn't spicy, the food is.)

## Steps

1. toast cumin seeds for 3-4 minutes in a hot pan, then grind with a mortar and pestle
2. grate half the cucumber and place in a bowl, dice the other half
3. add yoghurt, salt, and almost all the mint, cucumber, chilli and cumin and mix well
4. sprinkle remaining mint, cucumber, chilli and cumin on top and serve.

Goes well with biryani. Don't use any non-fresh powders in raita, a wise cook once told me. Simple is good. Resist the urge to add more things.
