Makes kebabs for frying or grilling. Goes well in burgers.

## Ingredients

- 1.5 can chickpeas, drained, well-rinsed and mashed (or use 1 chickpea, 1/2 can black beans)
- 1 red onion, finely diced
- 1 small zucchini, grated (around 1-1.5 cups grated)
- small beetroot, grated
- 1 bunch finely chopped coriander
- 2 spicy chillis finely chopped 
- 3 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 1 tbsp sriracha sauce
- 2 tbsp smooth peanut butter
- 1 tsp cumin
- 2 tsp garlic (crushed from bottle)
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp sea salt (or 1/2 for salt haters)
- 1 cup quick oats or rolled oats
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 

## Directions

1. After draining and rinsing the chickpeas and/or black beans, place them in a bowl and mash them with a super strong masher or use a food processor. Don't over fine them. Need some texture.
2. Add all the other ingredients to the bowl.
3. Use your hands to mix very well.
4. Make 7-8 patties and place on oven paper.
5. Cook on the BBQ for 5-8 minutes each side or until looking awesomely grilled.
6. You can also fry these in a pan with some oil for 3-5 minutes a side.

Make patties and freeze for later, leave out to thaw for 2 hrs before cooking.
