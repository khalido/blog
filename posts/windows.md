## Factory reset

Windows 10 gets slow and crufty over time. So once every few years, its good to start afresh. 

todo: how to factory reset windows 10


## Setup

install [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) by running this in powershell:

```
iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
scoop bucket add extras
```

- [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) for making bootable disks. [etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is a decent alternative, but not as reliable.
