A simple daal recipe.

1 cup of daal is approx 3-4 ppl. (much closer to 4).

## Ingredients

- 2 cups dhaal
- 2 tomatoes
- a decent amount of cumin seeds (more than a tsp, less than a tbsp)
- lots of garlic (3-5 cloves), or 2 tsp crushed garlic
- two fresh chillis (omit if kids)
- 1 cup frozen peas or some other veggie
- a bunch of coriander

## Spice

- 1 tsp chilli (use 1/2 tsp if kids)
- 2 tsp salt (1 tsp per cup of daal)
- pinch of tumeric/haldi
- 1/2 tsp garam masala

## Directions

- rinse lentils a few times, then soak for at least 30 minutes
- put lentils on low heat
- dice garlic and chuck into the dhal
- dice tomatoes and add to daal
- ditto all the spice and salt
- slice a chilli down the middle and toss it into the dhal

so now you have the dhal boiling away, which takes a while. Turn the heat up somewhat until the dhal comes to a boil and then put it down to low again.

## Daal topping 

Start this when the dhal seems to be about 10 minutes from being cooked:

- Take a non stick saucepan, and a liberal amount of oil, the base should be coated.
- thrown in cumin seeds into hot oil 
- 60 seconds later thrown in the garlic and rest of the chilli 
- soon after chuck in the peas/brocolli
- optional: once the veggies are a bit fried or if it looks like they are sticking to the pan, throw a some diced tomatoe

Add this to the daal once itâ€™s almost fully cooked, stir and leave for a few minutes.

Sprinkle coriander and serve with a side of cucumber.

## Tips:

- Don't worry too much about excess water as the veggies soak up a bit once you stir them in at the end, and Pakistani dhal is supposed to be a bit watery.
- This is for 2 cups of dhal, which should easily feed 4-5 ppl with rice.
- If the people are big eaters use 3 cups of dhal, proportions don't change much except for putting in a bit more spice mix
