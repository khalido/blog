A simple daal recipe.

1 cup of daal is approx 3-4 ppl. (much closer to 4).

## Ingredients

- 2 cups mixed dhal - 1 cup mung and 1 cup masoor
- 2 tomatoes chopped
- 1 onion, chopped fine
- a decent amount of cumin seeds (more than a tsp, less than a tbsp)
- lots of garlic (3-5 cloves), or 2 tsp crushed garlic
- a bit of ginger paste
- two fresh chillis (omit if kids)
- 1 cup frozen peas, defrost for a minute in boiling water and drain
- coriander, chopped

## Spice

- 1 tsp chilli (use 1/2 tsp if kids)
- 2 tsp salt (1 tsp per cup of daal)
- pinch of tumeric/haldi
- 1/4 tsp garam masala

## Directions

- rinse lentils a few times, then soak for at least 30 minutes
- put lentils on low heat
- add onions, tomatoes, garlic and ginger and then all the spices and salt. mix well.
- slice a chilli down the middle and toss it into the dhal
- turn the heat up until close to boiling, then put it on low heat to cook.

## bhaagar 

Start this when the dhal seems to be about 10 minutes from being cooked:

- Take a non stick saucepan, and a liberal amount of oil, the base should be coated.
- thrown in cumin seeds into hot oil 
- after 2-3 minutes add the peas, salt 

Add this to the daal once itâ€™s almost fully cooked, stir and leave for a few minutes.

Sprinkle coriander and serve with a side of cucumber.

## Tips:

- Don't worry too much about excess water as the veggies soak up a bit once you stir them in at the end, and Pakistani dhal is supposed to be a bit watery.
- This is for 2 cups of dhal, which should easily feed 4-5 ppl with rice.
- If the people are big eaters use 3 cups of dhal, proportions don't change much except for putting in a bit more spice mix
