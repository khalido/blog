4. plain yoghurt
5. coriander, heaps of it (chopped)
6. optional: paneer or tofu or vegetables (cooked separately and added at the end)

2. coriander powder

## steps

2. heat oil
3. add tomotoes
4. add ginger and chillis right after
5. add spices right after
6. stir then put a lid on for it just a bit 
7. remove lid & add 2 tablespoons of yoghurt
8. fry without the lid until it turns back into tomatoe colour (the yoghurt will dissolve) - about ten minutes
