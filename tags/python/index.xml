      <description>Install Anaconda There seems to be two main ways to handle python packaging, pip with pipenv and conda. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone with conda, though it turns out I often have to use pip inside conda. Anyways, there is a cheatsheet, but here&amp;rsquo;s all I use:
 download and install anaconda from here. restart terminal and check anaconda is in the path by ECHO $SHELL  If its not in the path then:</description>

      <description>Notes for the Advent of Code 2016 programming challange.
 Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.</description>

      <description>It had been a while since I finished Udacity&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning course, so as a refresher I signed up for Andrew NG&amp;rsquo;s deeplearning.ai course.
These are my notes for the first course in the series: Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

      <description>These are my notes for Harvard&amp;rsquo;s 2015 CS109 class, which i went through with Sydney Machine Learning&amp;rsquo;s study group from Ausgust to October 2017 at Amazon Web Service&amp;rsquo;s sydney office.
Why CS109? This class was recommended at Quora and a few other places as being a good resource for practical data science, so here goes. These notes are updated as I work through the course syllabus and the labs and homeworks.</description>

      <description>My notes &amp;amp; files for Udacity&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning intro course.
Before the course starts:  Read Machine learning is fun Watch Andrew NG: Deep Learning in Practice (34 minutes) Go though UD730 deep learning course on Udacity Watch Learn tensorflow 3 hour video http://rodneybrooks.com/patrick-winston-explains-deep-learning/  Python resources The course recommneds knowing basic python from here, but I found the following two resources better:
 A whirlwind tour of Python Python Data Science Handbook  Math resources Need to know multivariable calculus &amp;amp; linear algebra.</description>

      <description>I really liked this class - it was a engaging course to do after having done some intro level stuff.
 6.00.2x will teach you how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals and provides you with a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving . This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity.</description>

      <description>This was one of Udacity&amp;rsquo;s first computer science MOOC&amp;rsquo;s, and I really liked it. Its a great fast intro to computer science concepts and python.
In particular, I liked that the class both had a cameo by Google&amp;rsquo;s founder and the final project was to build a simple version of Google&amp;rsquo;s original search engine using the pagerank algorithim.</description>
