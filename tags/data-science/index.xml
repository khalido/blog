      <description>These are my notes for Harvard&amp;rsquo;s 2015 CS109 class, which i went through with Sydney Machine Learning&amp;rsquo;s study group from Ausgust to October 2017 at Amazon Web Service&amp;rsquo;s sydney office.
Why CS109? This class was recommended at Quora and a few other places as being a good resource for practical data science, so here goes. These notes are updated as I work through the course syllabus and the labs and homeworks.</description>

      <description>I really liked this class - it was a engaging course to do after having done some intro level stuff.
 6.00.2x will teach you how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals and provides you with a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving . This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity.</description>
