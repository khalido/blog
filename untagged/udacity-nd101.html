<h3 id="fast-style-transfer">fast-style transfer</h3>
<p>Looking at<a href="https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer">an existing style transfer deep learning script</a> to play around with. Hmm.. interesting to see what can be done but HOW is it done is the q?</p>
<h3 id="deep-traffic-simulator"><a href="http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptrafficjs/">Deep Traffic</a> simulator</h3>
<p>See the <a href="http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/">overview</a> for how to tinker with the inputs to train the simple neural network. Interesting to see how inputs drastically effect the quality of the output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptrafficjs/">DeepTraffic</a> is a gamified simulation of typical highway traffic. Your task is to build a neural agent â€“ more specifically design and train a neural network that performs well on high traffic roads. Your neural network gets to control one of the cars (displayed in red) and has to learn how to navigate efficiently to go as fast as possible. The car already comes with a safety system, so you donâ€™t have to worry about the basic task of driving â€“ the net only has to tell the car if it should accelerate/slow down or change lanes, and it will do so if that is possible without crashing into other cars.</p>

<h2 id="model-evaluation-and-validation">Model Evaluation and Validation</h2>
<p>Generalization is better than overfitting.</p>
<p>R2 score
- simplest possible model is to take the avg of all values and draw a straight line, then calculate the mean square error
 - the R2 score is 1 minus the error of our regression model divided by the error of the simplest possible model
 - if we have a good model, the error will be small compared to the simple model, thus R2 will be close to 1
 - for a bad model, the ratio of errors will be closer to 1, giving a small R2 values</p>

<h2 id="sentiment-analysis-with-andrew-trask">Sentiment Analysis with Andrew Trask</h2>
<p>This was a good project - built a simple neural network to classify reviews as negative or positive.</p>
<h2 id="intro-to-tflearn">Intro to TFLearn</h2>
<p>Sigmoid activation functions have a max derivate of .25, so errors shrink by 75% or more during backprogation. This means the neural network takes a long time to train. Instead of sigmoid, most DL networks use RLU - which is a supersimple function which outputs max(input, 0). For a +ve inut the output equals the input, and for a -ve input the output is 0. Relu nodes can die if there is a large graident through them, so they are best used with a small learning rate.</p>
<p>For a simple binary classification, the sigmoid function works, but for mulitple outputs, for example reconigizing digits, use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">softmax</a> function. A softmax function squashes outputs to be b/w 0 and 1 and divides them such that the total sum of the output equals 1.</p>
<p>one hot encoding means using a simple vector, like <code>y=[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]</code> to represent 4.</p>

<h2 id="intro-to-tensorflow">Intro to <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a></h2>
<p>Deep learning is a family of techniques which adapts to all sorts of data and problems. the basic techiniques of DL apply to a bunch of diff fields. Neural Networks have been around for decades but had pretty much disappread from the CS science. They came back in a bigway in the 2010's with advances in speech reconizition, computer vision and machine translation. This was enabled by lots of data and cheap gpus.</p>
<p>All the hotness is in my <a href="https://github.com/khalido/nd101/blob/master/intro_to_tensorflow.ipynb">intro to tensorflow notebook</a>.</p>
<h1 id="week-6">Week 6</h1>
<p>Going deeper into tensorflow!</p>
<h3 id="preventing-overfitting">Preventing overfitting</h3>
<p><strong>Early Termination</strong>: stop training soon as you stop improving</p>
<p><strong>Regulariation</strong> applies constrains - L2 regularization adds another term to the loss which penalizes large weights.</p>
<p><strong>Dropout</strong> is an important technique - it randomly stops half the signals flowing throgh a layer, and multiplies by 2 the remaining signals. This forces the NN to make redundant representations for everything - so with only partial info it can predict the right answer.
During testing, you cancel the dropout to maximize the predictive power of the model.</p>
<p><strong>get rid of unnecessary info</strong> For example, when reconigizing letters, the colors don't matter, so transform R,G,B values into grayscale by (R+G+B)/2.</p>
<p><strong>weight sharing</strong> say you have two kittens in the same image. so it makes sense to train the same part of the network on each kitten. we do this be weight sharing.</p>
<p><strong>statistical invariants</strong> things which don't change across time and space, like say the word kitten in a text, it always refers to kittens.</p>
<h2 id="convolution-networks-or-cnn">Convolution Networks, or CNN</h2>
<p>A CNN breaks up an image into many pieces and learns to first reconigzie basic shapes, lines, curves, then the more complex objects as combinations of the simpler shapes, then classifies the image by combining the complex objects together. A CNN can have many layers, with each layer capturing a different level of complexity.</p>

<p>todo: make a simple mnist NN with tensorboard summaries of different parameters. something like:</p>

    for num_layers in [1, 2]:

<p>.....</p>
<h2 id="weight-initialization">Weight Initialization</h2>
<p>The initial value of weights is very important to how well a NN trains. If all the weights start of the same, it makes it hard to update the weights since they end up all giving similar outputs, making it hard for the NN to learn.</p>
<p>Random weights work much better. Tensorflow's <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/random_uniform">tf.random_uniform()</a> is a good weight initilization function. Be default, tf.random.uniform picks float values uniformly spread b/w 0 and 1, which is decent, but we can do better.</p>
<p>Smart people have tested out different initial weights, and it seems using weights distributed around zero with a std dev around 0.1 works well, with tails cut off. Tensorflow has a built in function:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/truncated_normal">tf.truncated_normal</a> which generates a random normal distribution around zero with values &gt; 2 std devs from the mean repicked. So making 3 weights would look someething like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">weights = [
    tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal(layer_1_weight_shape, stddev=0.1)),
    tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal(layer_2_weight_shape, stddev=0.1)),
    tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal(layer_3_weight_shape, stddev=0.1))
</code></pre>
<p>A normal distribution means that the weights will tend to be closer to the mean rather than uniformly distributed.</p>
<p>todo: run a simple network on MNIST with different weights and see in tensorboard
todo: find some approchable resources on weights</p>

<h2 id="project-4-translation">Project 4 - Translation</h2>
<p>use a rnn to translate english to french.</p>
<p>Project is built on TF 1.0, so see <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/RELEASE.md">release notes</a> for later versions as TF changed some RNN bits.</p>
<p>I had a problem with training times. Even on a GPU it took forever. This is with relatively limited data, with a decently sized data it will take a looong time!</p>
<p>Questions to ponder:</p>
<ul>
<li>should the encoding &amp; decoding embed size be exactly the vocab size?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parameters which should give &gt; 90% accuracy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>epochs = 3</li>
<li>batch_size = 256</li>
<li>rnn_size = 128</li>
<li>num_layers = 2</li>
<li>encoding_embedding_size = 256</li>
<li>decoding_embedding_size = 256</li>
<li>learning_rate = 0.005</li>
<li>keep_probability = 0.9</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gans">GANS</h2>
<p>Gans use a differentiable function represented by a NN to transform an output from an input (generally random noise?).</p>
<p>A second network, called the discriminator, which is just a regular NN classifier which has been trained on real images, gives the generated image a probablity of being real or fake. The discriminator receives a mix of real images and generated images.</p>
<p>Over time, the generator gets good at generating images which passes the discrimator's test.</p>
<p>Game theory tells us that the two NN's should come to a equilibrium where neither NN can improve their situation.</p>
<p>We train both networks alternately - look up best practices.</p>

Relatively straigtforward, but adding in <a href="https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/batch-norm/Batch_Normalization_Lesson.ipynb">batch normalization</a> involves some tensorflow kungfu. Doing this project in TF made me yearn for Keras.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/batch_normalization">batch_norm layer in TF</a> isn't magical enough, so we have to wrap the train operations inside tf.control_dependencies block so the batch normalization layers get updated. The below is the code from <a href="https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/dcgan-svhn/DCGAN.ipynb">Udacty</a> but since I added batch norm to both the generator and the discriminator this didn't work for me:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with tf.control_dependencies(tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)):
        d_train_opt = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate, beta1=beta1).minimize(d_loss, var_list=d_vars)
        g_train_opt = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate, beta1=beta1).minimize(g_loss, var_list=g_vars)
</code></pre>
<p>After much googling and help from the forums, this worked:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># need this to make batch normalization work properly during inference
    update_ops = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)
    g_updates  = [opt for opt in update_ops if opt.name.startswith('generator')]

    with tf.control_dependencies(g_updates):
        d_train_opt = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate, beta1).minimize(d_loss, var_list=d_vars)
        g_train_opt = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate, beta1).minimize(g_loss, var_list=g_vars)
</code></pre>
<p>Putting this here becuase there must be better/simpler easier way to do batch_norm without getting into the graph bowels of tensorflow.</p>
<p>todo: reimplement in Keras</p>
