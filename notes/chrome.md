Notes on making Google chrome work for me. Needs updating for 2020.

The two top things:

- sign in to a google account and save personal info, cc and imp passwords. This essentially gives you super powers browsing the internet. 
- use a add blocker.

## Flags

Some of these flags get set by 

- Quiet notifications: `chrome://flags/#quiet-notification-prompts` kills the annoying notifications popups, just displays a bell in the notification bar instead. You can also choose to just block them altogether, but I like this compromise.
- Dark Mode: `chrome://flags/#enable-force-dark` forces dark mode
    - Make tab titles prominent in dark mode: `chrome://flags/#prominent-dark-mode-active-tab-title`

## Extensions

**Block adds:** [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) is essential, can't use computers without it anymore. [Click here on the chrome web store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) to install.

**Vim style keyboard shortcuts:** [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/)
