<p>There are lots of things people are working on, as well as tons of existing information out there.</p>
<p>Prototype:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/img/prototype_chat_1.png" /> <img alt="" src="/img/prototype_chat_2.png" /></p>
<p>Have a simple, easy to use way to ask questions about services available, and where possible help the user to use them by asking questions relevant for that service and filling out the form (or sending the relevant link).</p>
<ul>
<li>remembers user info entered, making it more useful over time (cause it remembers all the info entered)</li>
<li>two main uses:</li>
<li>answers questions, like what scholarships are available, nearby migrant relevant centers, etc etc</li>
<li>fills out forms, starting with school forms (then medicare, centrelink, whatever could be usefulâ€¦)</li>
</ul>
<p>More advanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>use google translate to ask questions in the users native language, and then translate back the answers to fill out forms in english</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="plan">plan</h2>
<p>[x] get prototype up and running
[ ] setup python/flask powered API endpoint which takes in data and returns answers, forms etc
[ ] TALK TO THE RIGHT PPPL then
[ ] make a top ten list of useful qs the bot can answer and put info in airtable/gsheets
  - scholarships, schools, nearby services
