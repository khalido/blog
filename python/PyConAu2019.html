<h2 id="you-dont-always-need-numpy">You dont always need NumPy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The numerical Python ecosystem and communities are mature and powerful, but sometimes we can be too quick to reach for the numerical hammer when simpler options exist. This talk will outline some areas where the numerical stack may not be the best starting point, and survey some alternatives. <a href="https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/you-dont-always-need-numpy">#</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-hames-946b9478/">Sam Hames</a>, software dev at QUT’s Digital Observatory.</li>
<li>the numerical python stack is very complicated, and its a differnt idiom to the other types of python</li>
<li>numpy is basically arrays and vectorized expressions on these arrays - but how to translate - for example using a dict to represent a bag of words <code>{'the': 21, 'bag': 2}</code> - its clear, there is a one to one mapping b/w word and its count - but using numpy arrays breaks that, you end up with two arrays like <code>[21,2]</code> and <code>['the', 'bag']</code></li>
<li>when writing numerical python, remember that the rest of python exists</li>
<li>pythons built in data structures- lists, sets, dicts and tuples exist and are very very good - you can use them in many applications instead of numpy!</li>
<li>depending on the task, sometimes you need that numpy speed for certain ops</li>
<li>lists - appends are fast, you can have dicts of lists</li>
<li>sets - adding, deleting and checking membership are all fast</li>
<li>tuples - work very well for things like metadata description, and you can have a set of tuples (you can't have a set of lists)</li>
<li>combining python data structures is easier to understand</li>
<li>the stdlib has lots of things built in:</li>
<li>collections:<ul>
<li>defaultdict can simplify code</li>
<li>Counter - count all the things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>heapq</li>
<li>bisect</li>
<li>Generators and streaming - you will run out of memory at some point</li>
<li>example <code>pandas.read_csv</code> is used a lot but it fits the whole file into memory - instead you can read a file line by line by using
  -</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('very_big_file.txt', 'r') as f:
  for line in f:
    results = (do_something(line) for line in f)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>maybe don't do everything in python, use a database?</li>
<li>sqlite can do a lot of stuff, example compute and store a bag of words</li>
<li>there are lots of domain specific databases, both local and hosted, and they can be a great complement to a python stack</li>
<li>this way you only have to worry about a subset of the original python</li>
<li>look for task specific libs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>takeaway:</strong> document all the numerical things, and don't be afraid to mix and match. Whats the actual problem you're solving - does it matter if its taking 1ms in numpy vs 5ms in python?</p>
<h2 id="flying-by-the-seat-of-our-pants-our-journey-of-teaching-python-using-drones">Flying by the seat of our pants: our journey of teaching python using drones</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago we found ourselves teaching students everything from Python to Arduino. It was our plan to replace all the other languages with Python as we streamlined our course. Learn why we introduced drones, what we learned not to do and what we were surprised about. <a href="https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/flying-by-the-seat-of-our-pants--our-journey-of-teaching-python-using-drones">#</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Kylie Mathers - teacher at Marymount catholic school in Qld</li>
<li>the school used a veritable kitchen sink of languages, wanted to switch to one language, preferrably open source, which was useful after students left school and worked with prototyping electronics (beeps and leds makes kids heads light up)</li>
<li>some considerations:</li>
<li>block based programming is too..ugh</li>
<li>Apple swift and playgrounds need ipads, those are expensive and lock you in</li>
<li>they had drones, wanted to use them, and guess what, you have <a href="https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot">libs like pyparrot</a> to program drones in python</li>
<li>drumroll.... they choose python!</li>
<li>the talk covered introducing students to the big picture concept of drones, their issues and applications and things to think about</li>
<li>so after ages, the students finally went hands on with python and drones</li>
<li>used psuedo code, flowcharts to explain concepts</li>
<li>then real code, including functions like <code>make_it_rock</code>, <code>circle</code> etc etc</li>
<li>seeing the drone do stuff in real life becuase of their code was very motivating</li>
<li>highly visible learning is great.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>takeaway:</strong> theres a lot to research and think about before even starting to code and fly a drone. I guess that applies to programing in general - so much problems in python are best approached after a literature research for best practices.</p>
<p>Highly visibile reactions are great, so try and use that with real projects as well.</p>
<h2 id="using-dash-by-plotly-for-interactive-visualisation-of-crime-data">Using Dash by Plotly for Interactive Visualisation of Crime Data</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://plot.ly/dash/">Dash</a> is a great Python framework for building data visualisation websites. In this talk I discuss the framework basics, explore a sample site and describe its use for an enterprise application to graph crime statistics. I finish with clear pros and cons of the Dash framework from our perspective. <a href="https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/using-dash-by-plotly-for-interactive-visualisation-of-crime-data">#</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leobroska">Leo Broska</a> <a href="https://github.com/halloleo">github</a>, software dev at ACIS, works with criminal data</li>
<li>with any numerical data, eventually you have to put it into a graph or dashboard</li>
<li>Dash is a python framework for building analytical websites, with no javascript required</li>
<li><a href="https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/">dash example apps:</a></li>
<li>plotly does all the drawing and charts in dash, and react powers the interactivity layer for dash, flask actually delivers the webapp - every dash site is a flask app</li>
<li>there is not need to call the internal components of dash for simple things</li>
<li>Make a simple dash app:</li>
<li>import your data, make a figure object which graphs/maps it using plotly express. use <code>fig.update_traces</code> to tweak the fig object.</li>
<li>then make a dash app, give it a layout - this defines what the app is serving, which is typically html or markdown text and the plot objects created earlier</li>
<li>now run the app!</li>
<li>Note: use a server like gunicorn for production</li>
<li>dash is great but some issues:</li>
<li>slow, rendering is slow, underlying javascript code very big</li>
<li>multi-page sites awkward to code</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>takeaway:</strong> Just tried out plotly on my laptop, and it is a bit slow. Use it with caution as needed. It looks great for internal dashboard where you have beefy machines and fast connections to users, for personal use to dump on the internet a dash app is a hefty thing to host.</p>

<h2 id="forecasting-australias-2019-election-with-pymc3">Forecasting Australias 2019 Election with PyMC3</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we predict the result of an Australian election before it occurs? How certain of the outcome can we be? My talk will use the 2019 Australian federal election as a case study to provide an entry-level introduction to the benefits of probabilistic forecasting and PyMC3. <a href="https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/forecasting-australias-2019-election-with-pymc3">#</a></p>

<li>prob forecasting tries to estimate te relative prob of all possible outcomes e.g weather forecasting</li>
<li>the future is uncertain, and prob forecasting gives us an estimate of how likely different outcomes are</li>
<li>ppl have different starting assumptions, probabilistic forecasting defines them up front</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.pymc.io">PyMC3</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>takeaway</strong>: forecasts with probabilities are much more useful than just a plain number. With the last Australian elections, practically every channel had just the one number for wins - but if they had attaced a likeihood to it and shown the other likely scenarios it would have been a lot more useful.</p>

<h2 id="cudf-rapids-gpu-accelerated-dataframe-library">cuDF: RAPIDS GPU Accelerated Dataframe Library</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>RAPIDS open-source software enables end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines to run entirely on GPUs. Key to RAPIDS is cuDF, a pandas-like Python data frame library with a high-performance CUDA C++ implementation. cuDF and RAPIDS enable large speedups for end-to-end data science using GPUs. <a href="https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/cudf-rapids-gpu-accelerated-dataframe-library">#</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mark Harris, engr at <a href="https://rapids.ai">rapids</a>.</li>
<li>moving and transforming data is slow</li>
<li>data processing evolution for query, ETL and ML train steps:</li>
<li>hadoop would read and write data to disk at every step</li>
<li>apache spark kept data in memory all the time</li>
<li>traditional gpu processing would read data into gp, do something then write to cpu. a lot of gpu speed gains were lost in the read write steps</li>
<li>apache arrow provides a common in memory data format so different tools can use the same format and save the data conversion steps</li>
<li>rapids uses arrow to skip many of the data conversion steps, much faster</li>
<li>rapids aims to accelerate existing python tools, like the pydata chain</li>
<li>the average data scientist spends 90% of their time in ETL</li>
<li>enter cdDF: rapids dataframes to save the day by drastically speeding up ETL</li>
<li>runs on libcuDF, a low level CUDA C++ lib which does all the work on the GPU</li>
<li>cuDF provides a pandas like api, creates gpu dataframes from numpy arrays, pandas dataframes or pyarrow tables</li>
<li>bridges python (a dynamic language) with C++ &amp; Cuda (static languages)</li>
<li>gpu accelerated i/o - 10x faster than pandas</li>
<li>rapids speeds up workflows on a single pc with one gpu - for bigger data it works with dask for distributed computing</li>
<li>cuML algorithms are largely compatible with sklearn, just much faster</li>
<li>1 v100 gpu is 5-100x faster than 2x20 core cpu.</li>
<li>a regular desktop gpu is plenty fast too for a normal user</li>
<li>Rapids works in Google Colab, see <a href="https://rapids.ai/start.html">getting started</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>takeaway:</strong> should drastically speed up many of the bigger datasets I've tried in pandas, where a clean and transform pipeline would take many minutes. cuDF promises to at drastically speed up this process, making it easier to iterate faster.</p>
<p>So look into getting a Nvidia powered computer suitable for using with rapids, this would have drastically sped up some of my machine learning projects.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-gpus">Understanding GPUs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>With torch and tensorflow we have begun to rely on GPUs to speed up computations. Deep Learning or not, GPUs can provide massive computation speed ups but it’s not a panacea as NVIDIA would have you believe. Understanding how GPUs work can tell us where we should and shouldn’t use them. <a href="https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/understanding-gpus">#</a></p>

<li>Varun Nayyar, mathematician - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/varun-nayyar-94222647/?originalSubdomain=au">linkedin</a></li>
<li>what are GPU's good for? graphics can be fundamentally reduced to matrix operations, DL is just matrix multiplication with a non linearity.</li>
<li>CUDA: gpu's are made up of streaming multiprocessors (SM's) each with many cuda cores, say 64-128. They run thousands of threads simultanesouly vs 10s for a cpu.</li>
<li>real world cuda threads are divided into blocks of 32 threads called a warp, and threads in a warp run at the same time.</li>
<li>a rtx2080ti can run over 4K threads in one go</li>
<li>GPU's are generally memory bound, not compute bound.</li>
<li>Deep learning: each forward pass is just a matrix multiply, as is backprop</li>
<li>Gradient Descent is a sequential algorithim - gpu compute hasn't changed how it works, just makes it faster by 20-30x on a fully connected network.</li>
<li>Convolutions are compute bound on a gpu, easy to parralize</li>
<li>RNN's are memory bound</li>
<li>gpu's work well with GradientBoosting</li>
<li>gpu's have variable perf depending on the algo, so its not straigtforward to put algorithms on the gpu. CPU and GPU implementations can differ.</li>
<li>gpu sync is slow - stick with single gpu's for personal use, you need a strong engineering team for multi-gpus.</li>
<li>local compute is great - pays for itself soon over paying for cloud. don't skimp - go for a rtx2080ti</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>takeaways:</strong> very impressive talk. Worth rewatching if doing something with GPU's. For my next ML project consider getting my own gpu box running linux and look at libraries like rapids.</p>

<li>basics: grab signals from the brainusing EEG, do real time analysis, send a feedback signal</li>
<li>brain has many neurons, when a neuron fires a electrical field is generated which is pretty tiny - but when many neurons fire together it makes a big field which you can measure from even outside the brain</li>
<li>signal changes with action - exampls eyes open/close.</li>
<li>eeg resolution is quite poor/limited</li>
<li>EEG signals can have rythyms, so thus you can do frequency analysis</li>
<li><a href="https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html">mne</a> - open source python lib for neurophysical data</li>
<li>for better signals - you have to measure from inside the brain - see neuralink.</li>
<li>eeg is non-invasive, portable and cheap</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer">labstreaminglayer</a> is a good library to stream realtime data from a measuring device.</li>

<ul>
<li>Aurynn Shaw <a href="https://twitter.com/aurynn">@aurynn</a>, devops at Eiora</li>
<li>talk is about introducing change</li>
<li>spoke about <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=contempt+culture">Contempt culture</a> in the tech world</li>
<li>what has pervasive hostility done in tech jobs?</li>
<li>all new tech exists in a business context, and biz don't care about technologies. Devs care about tech, not businesses.</li>
<li>biz cares about outcomes - can i deploy it, can i find ppl to work on it and the other things biz needs to care about</li>
<li>expressing opinions in contemptuous terms gets you sidelined and not trusted</li>
<li>you diss one tech, like another tech - makes you look biased</li>
<li>we have done this to ourselves.</li>
<li>if they think its necessary and we don't or vice versa its not them at fault there is a communications gap.</li>
<li>and thus we end up in a process which doesn't believe in engineers.</li>
<li>we should not be speaking only in a language of tech and treat our assumptions as better - we need to speak in the language of biz</li>
<li>processes and status quos arise from past biz experiences</li>
<li>the cloud is where infrastructure as code become real - 13 yrs ago. Some companies are still having conversations about entering the cloud. Cause they don't care about the tech and ease of the cloud, they care about risks and costs and regulations and so on.. the easy of spinning up services is a small thing.</li>
<li>someone needs to communicate that</li>
<li>power dynamics dictate change</li>
<li>listening is key to change</li>
<li>new processes need to make the lives of others betters and show them how its solving problems (and in the process you get to roll out the shiny new tech you care about)</li>
<li>all technology is political - tech encodes the structures of the org which made it</li>
<li>things which make no sense often are because of the initial org constraints, and thats why they don't make sense to a different org with different constraints</li>
<li>understand the political ramifications of tech</li>
<li>go and talk to ppl. make conversations safe.</li>
<li>good example of Etsy</li>
<li>learn to speak business. Be empathetic to the entire org.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>takeaways:</strong> Its not just them, its us. Solve business problems and communicate how your solution helps. Don't spend too much time on <em>we should have done it right in the first place.</em> It just so happens that we adopt new tech as sometimes its better/faster/cheaper than the old.</p>

<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pactman/">pactman</a> for contract testing of services</li>
<li>django to deliver the services</li>
<li>inconsistencies happen, so you have to check across teams. i.e one team switched tool cause they found it too hard, so now you have inconsistencies across projects</li>
<li>resilience: microservices are prone to brief errors or tiny service interruptions. So use http retries for some errors</li>
<li>moniter services using <a href="https://grafana.com">grafana dashboards</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">kibana</a> for monitering and searching logs</li>

<li>reducing number of sql queries was key to speed</li>
<li>batch interfaces is good, like allow consumer to get 100 price requests in one go, much faster than 100 different requests</li>
<li>caching really helped. <code>@lru_cache(maxsize=1024)</code> decorator built into python does the job.</li>

<li>one construction site next to hospitals, lab etc which can't be disturbed - so they have a bunch of quantative requirements to meet and report on in real time.</li>
<li>so, how to keep track of all the requirements?</li>
<li>old school approach was to send grad engineers to site, collect readings, analyze in excel and file reports at the end of the month</li>
<li>modern approach: get sensors from a Vendor with a Saas platform, give them lots of money, download csvs, analyzie in excel and file reports at the end of the month.</li>
<li>they don't respond to custom reports, don't integrate with other vendors sensors</li>
<li>solution: build a new platform which could accept data from any device</li>
<li>hint: try not to work with devices directly</li>
<li>150-200 sensors, some sending data at a half second freq</li>
<li>validate and store telemetry</li>
<li>envirnomental requirements don't map directly to sensor data, so calculations needed to transform them - which are sometimes complex, and have to performed in real time</li>
<li>access to data - both internal as well as limited external access</li>

<li>these add up quickly to a lot of stuff</li>
<li>so instead they are using jupyter notebook</li>
<li>shapefiles store shapes like the railway line and vegetation and noise senstitive areas</li>

<li>they need to know as soon as the DA comes in as it could pose a high risk to the railway design</li>
<li>DABot automates this - it merges geocoded national address file and lot shape datasets, filters for lots on the buffer alighnment, which gives a list of addressses which they can use to search for DA's matching those addresses.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Python and serverless technologies are a great way to quickly scale a project, but what can you do when things get complicated? Here are some patterns to keep you sane. <a href="https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/orchestrating-complex-not-complicated-tasks-using-aws-serverless-and-python">#</a></p>

<li>lambda functions</li>
<li>adv: cheaper, little config, encourages refactoring, easy learning curve</li>
<li>limitations: runtime limits</li>
<li>use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/">aws step functions</a> to build a state machine to connect different services together, trigger lambads and so on</li>
<li>state machines hold state unlike lambdas</li>
<li>see talk for project template example</li>
<li>use <a href="https://github.com/psf/black">black</a> for code linting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>takeaway:</strong> instead of making overly complex lambda functions, model the problem as a finite state machine, make simple lambdas as appropriate then make a state machine which embeds some of the logic and calls lambdas.</p>
<p>Then you can make a state machine to watch over all your other state machines!</p>

<li>cool new thing</li>
<li>basics of QM: instead of bits, you have qbits which have a vector instead of being a 0 or 1.</li>

<li>talk about fear of removing old and semi dead bits of the stdlib</li>
<li>pep594 will break a lot of corporate code which doesn't have replacements - this places the burden of maintainence from the corporations to python</li>
<li>some of the libs broken can be easily updated</li>
<li>make pythons development easier, kill the nasty old bits</li>

<h2 id="mega-takeaway">mega takeaway</h2>
<p>Its nice to hear talks in real life instead of on youtube. Focuses the attention.</p>
<p>Moving forward, my biggest takeaway is to take an idea and just run with it. Many of the speakers had an itch - a home to automate with python, a paper to write or drones to fly and just did it. So take one of my project ideas and just do it, using circleci of course.</p>

<li>can't use <code>'</code> or <code>-</code> in anchor links for some reason. Chrome doesn't jump to anchors! Bad chrome!</li>
