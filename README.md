Herin lies a mixed up blog, notes, reviews, recepies, whatever else I might want to possible refer back to in the future.

Posts use yaml, each post should have this at the top as a min:

```
---
title: "how the blog was built"
date: 2020-07-14
tags:
- python
---
```

The title becomes the h1 heading for the post.
